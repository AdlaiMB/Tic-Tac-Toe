## How I approached styling 

For this project, I decided to use the CUBE CSS methodology. Previously for styling, I was pixel-pushing/winging it, which 
caused a lot of inconsistencies and extra work. I referred to the docs frequently to make sure I was following the 'rules'
they detailed; however, I may have written some CSS that may not abide by the rules, but I will get better with more practice.
